<h2 style=background-color:lightgrey;”>Introduction</h2>
<p>A hobby is typically something someone does for <strong>pleasure, entertainment, or relaxation purposes. </strong> Hobbies are activities that you enjoy doing, and allow you to express your creative abilities. <br>Today I will be going through <strong> 3 of my favourite hobbies </strong> and explain why they are of interest to me. </br> </p>

<p><strong>Art </strong>is a fun way to express your <em>creative abilities.</em> Art also allows me to keep my mind off of things. In art you can switch around from different materials to experiment with them and see which medium works best for you. <br> In any piece of artwork I am able to <strong>vent out my feelings</strong> and place them on the page. Whenever I experience a sensation of joy I would typically use colours that link with happiness such as yellow to make my artwork.</br> Sometimes it’s hard to express your emotions through words, but art allows me to display my thoughts through colours, lines and shapes on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Some of the most common art mediums are listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Coloured pencils</li>
<li>Acrylic paint</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Watercolour</li>

<p> <strong>Photography</strong> is another of my interests. Photography allows one to <em>capture important moments </em>and those moments serve as a reminder of past events that had either brought us joy, sadness, or excitement. <br>Photography is also a form of art, pictures that are well taken can show the beauty in even the simplest things.</br></p>

<p> <strong>Reading</strong> is not only interesting for me, but it opens up a fantasy world where I can essentially escape from reality. <br>Not only is reading one of my favourite things to do in my free time, but studies have also shown that reading <em> improves your vocabulary significantly,</em> along with your comprehension abilities. </br> </p>
